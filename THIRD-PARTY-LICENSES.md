# Third-Party Software Licenses

**IMPORTANT:** This file documents the licenses of third-party dependencies used by MeasureMint. These licenses apply ONLY to the respective third-party packages, NOT to MeasureMint's proprietary code.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DISTINCTION

### MeasureMint Code = PROPRIETARY
**License:** Proprietary (see LICENSE file)  
**Copyright:** © 2025 Khaled Khalil. All Rights Reserved.  
**Status:** NOT open source, NOT for replication, NOT for commercial use by others

### Third-Party Dependencies = Various Open Source Licenses
**License:** MIT, BSD, etc. (as specified by each package)  
**Copyright:** Respective package authors  
**Status:** Open source packages that MeasureMint uses as dependencies

---

## 📋 Legal Clarification

### What You CAN Do:
✅ Use MIT-licensed packages in proprietary software (like MeasureMint)  
✅ Keep your own code proprietary and closed-source  
✅ Sell software that uses MIT-licensed dependencies  
✅ Prevent others from copying YOUR code

### What You CANNOT Do:
❌ Remove or change the licenses of third-party packages  
❌ Claim you wrote the third-party code  
❌ Prevent others from using the same open-source packages

### What This Means for MeasureMint:
- ✅ **Your code** (algorithms, UI, logic) = Fully proprietary
- ✅ **Your app** = Cannot be copied or replicated
- ✅ **Third-party tools** = Standard dependencies (like any software)
- ✅ **Your intellectual property** = Fully protected

## 🔒 MeasureMint Protection

Even though MeasureMint uses MIT-licensed dependencies:

1. **Your Code is Protected**
   - All MeasureMint source code is proprietary
   - Copyright © 2025 Khaled Khalil
   - Unauthorized use is illegal

2. **Your Algorithms are Protected**
   - Measurement calculations
   - Calibration logic
   - UI/UX design
   - Business logic

3. **Your App Cannot Be Replicated**
   - Even though dependencies are open source
   - Your unique combination and implementation is protected
   - Competitors cannot copy your code

4. **Analogy:**
   - Using React doesn't mean anyone can copy Facebook
   - Using Next.js doesn't mean anyone can copy Vercel
   - Using MIT packages doesn't mean anyone can copy MeasureMint
