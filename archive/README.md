# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation and legacy code that has been superseded but kept for reference.

## 📁 Contents

### `/legacy/` - Pre-Next.js Implementation
Legacy files from before the Next.js migration:
- `server.js` - Old Express server (replaced by Next.js API routes)
- `app.js` - Old application logic (replaced by React components)
- `measuremint.js` - Old measurement logic (replaced by React hooks)

## 🎯 Why Archive?

Rather than deleting historical documentation, we archive it for:
1. **Historical Context** - Understanding how the project evolved
2. **Reference** - Looking up old implementation details
3. **Audit Trail** - Documenting completed work
4. **Learning** - Seeing what was tried and why it changed
