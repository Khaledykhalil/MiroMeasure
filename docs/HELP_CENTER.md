---

## 🎯 How It Works

### The 3-Step Process

#### 1️⃣ **Calibration**
Set the scale by telling MeasureMint one known distance. This lets it calculate all other distances accurately.

**Example**: On a floor plan, if you know a wall is 10 feet, click both ends of that wall and enter "10 ft"

#### 2️⃣ **Choose Tool**
Select from 9 measurement tools:
- Linear Distance (most common)
- Perimeter
- Area
- Volume
- Angle
- And more...

#### 3️⃣ **Measure**
Click points on your board. MeasureMint calculates and displays the measurement instantly.

## 🔧 Calibration

### Why Calibrate?

Calibration tells MeasureMint the scale of your image. Without it, measurements would be in pixels (not useful!). With calibration, you get real-world measurements in feet, meters, or any unit you choose.

### Calibration Methods

#### **Method 1: Draw Calibration Line** (Recommended)
Best for: Most accurate results

1. Click **"Set Calibration"**
2. Click **"Draw New Line"**
3. Click two points on a **known distance**
4. Enter the **actual measurement** (e.g., "10 feet")
5. Choose axis: **Both**, **X-only**, or **Y-only**
6. Click **Save**

#### **Method 2: Scale Presets**
Best for: Standard architectural drawings

1. Click **"Scale Presets"**
2. Choose your scale:
   - **Imperial**: 1/4"=1', 1/8"=1', 1"=10', etc.
   - **Metric**: 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, etc.
3. Click **Apply**

#### **Method 3: Use Existing Line**
Best for: Quick measurements when lines exist

1. Draw a line or connector on your board
2. Place it on a known distance
3. Click **"Set Calibration"**
4. Click **"Use Existing Line"**
5. Select the line
6. Enter the actual measurement
7. Click **Save**

### Dual-Axis Calibration

**What is it?**
Separate calibration for X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes.

**When to use:**
- Distorted images (stretched or compressed)
- Scanned drawings that aren't perfectly square
- Photos taken at an angle
- Images with different scales on each axis

**How it works:**
1. Calibrate X-axis first (horizontal known distance)
2. Calibrate Y-axis second (vertical known distance)
3. MeasureMint uses both to calculate accurate measurements

## 🏗️ Use Cases

### Measuring Floor Plans

**Best practices:**
1. Use high-quality floor plan images
2. Find a known dimension (often doors are 3' wide)
3. Calibrate using that dimension
4. Measure all rooms, hallways, features
5. Export measurements for documentation

**Common measurements:**
- Room dimensions (length × width)
- Doorway widths (typically 30", 32", 36")
- Hallway widths
- Wall lengths
- Window sizes
- Total square footage

### Measuring Blueprints

**Best practices:**
1. Check if scale is labeled (e.g., "1/4" = 1'-0"")
2. Use Scale Presets if scale is known
3. Or calibrate using scale ruler on blueprint
4. Measure structural elements
5. Verify critical dimensions

**Common measurements:**
- Structural spans
- Column spacing
- Beam lengths
- Foundation dimensions
- Building envelope

### Working with Distorted Images

**Problem**: Image is stretched, compressed, or photographed at an angle

**Solution**: Dual-axis calibration

**Steps:**
1. Find a known **horizontal** distance
2. Calibrate **X-axis only**
3. Find a known **vertical** distance
4. Calibrate **Y-axis only**
5. Measure normally - MeasureMint handles the distortion!

## ✅ Best Practices

### For Accurate Measurements

1. **High-quality images**
   - Use clear, high-resolution images
   - Avoid pixelated or blurry images
   - Straight-on photos work best

2. **Accurate calibration**
   - Use the longest known distance available
   - Verify calibration with a second known distance
   - Recalibrate if image scale changes

3. **Zoom in**
   - Zoom in on the board for precise clicks
   - Especially important for small measurements
   - Use Miro's zoom tools (Cmd/Ctrl + scroll)

4. **Multiple measurements**
   - Take multiple measurements of critical dimensions
   - Average results for higher accuracy
   - Cross-check measurements

5. **Document your calibration**
   - Note what you used for calibration
   - Add text labels to calibration lines
   - Keep calibration visible for reference

### For Collaboration

1. **Share calibration**
   - Leave calibration lines on the board
   - Add notes explaining the calibration
   - Team members can measure using your calibration

2. **Label measurements**
   - Use Miro's text tool to label key measurements
   - Add measurement captions
   - Create a legend if needed

3. **Organize your board**
   - Group related measurements
   - Use frames to separate different areas
   - Color-code measurement types

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need to select an image before measuring?**
A: No! MeasureMint works anywhere on your Miro board. Just calibrate and measure.

**Q: Can multiple people use the same calibration?**
A: Yes! Once calibrated, anyone on the board can take measurements using that calibration.

**Q: Do measurements save with the board?**
A: Yes! Measurement lines and captions are standard Miro elements that save automatically.

**Q: Can I measure on PDFs?**
A: Yes! Upload PDFs to Miro, then calibrate and measure normally.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many measurements I can take?**
A: No limits! Measure as much as you need.

A: Accuracy depends on your calibration. With accurate calibration and high-quality images, measurements are typically within 1-2% of actual dimensions.

**Q: Do I need to recalibrate for each measurement?**
A: No! Calibrate once per image/scale. All measurements use that calibration.

**Q: What if I don't know any dimensions?**
A: Use Scale Presets if the scale is labeled (e.g., "1:100"). Or use common references (standard doors are often 3 feet wide).

**Q: Can I have multiple calibrations on one board?**
A: Yes! Use Scale Regions to define different areas with different calibrations.

**Q: What if my image is rotated?**
A: No problem! MeasureMint works at any rotation. Just calibrate normally.

### Measurement Questions

**Q: Can I measure curved lines?**
A: Yes! Use Multi-Point Distance and click points along the curve.

**Q: How do I measure area?**
A: Use the Area tool and click points to define the shape.
