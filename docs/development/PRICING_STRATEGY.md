## 📊 Pricing Rationale

### Current Recommendation: **$9.99/month**

#### Why This Price Point?

**1. Value-Based Pricing**
- **Time savings**: Saves hours of manual measurement work
- **Accuracy**: Reduces errors in critical professional work
- **Convenience**: First-ever measurement tool for Miro
- **ROI**: For professionals, $10/month is negligible vs. time saved

**2. Market Positioning**
- **Below premium tools** ($15-20/month) - More accessible
- **Above consumer apps** ($2-5/month) - Professional positioning
- **Sweet spot** for B2B SaaS tools ($8-12/month range)

**3. Psychological Pricing**
- **$9.99** feels like single digits (vs. $10)
- **Under $10** is impulse purchase territory for professionals
- **$99/year** = "less than $100" psychological barrier

**4. Conversion Optimization**
- **Low enough** to convert free users easily
- **High enough** to filter serious users
- **Sustainable** for business growth

#### Is $9.99 Too High or Too Low?

**Analysis:**

✅ **Just Right** - Here's why:

**Too Low (< $7/month):**
- ❌ Undervalues the tool
- ❌ Attracts price-sensitive users (higher churn)
- ❌ Less sustainable revenue
- ❌ Harder to justify premium features

**Too High (> $15/month):**
- ❌ May price out individual professionals
- ❌ Harder to justify for occasional users
- ❌ Competes with full CAD suites
- ❌ Slower adoption

**$9.99/month is optimal because:**
- ✅ Accessible to individual professionals
- ✅ Affordable for small firms
- ✅ Still premium positioning
- ✅ Good value perception
- ✅ Sustainable unit economics
